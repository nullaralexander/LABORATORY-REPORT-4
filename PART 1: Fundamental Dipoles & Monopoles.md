# PART 1: Fundamental Dipoles & Monopoles

# INTRODUCTION
The study of antenna theory begins with the analysis of Fundamental Dipoles and Monopoles, which serve as the essential building blocks for nearly all modern wireless communication systems. These antennas are characterized by their ability to convert electrical energy into electromagnetic waves through resonant current distribution along a conductive element. In this section, the research focuses on the relationship between physical geometry and electrical performance, specifically examining how variations in wavelength—such as the λ 2 and 3/2λ configurations—alter radiation characteristics. By observing the behavior of the Hertz antenna and the Ground Plane monopole, we can evaluate the foundational principles of omnidirectional radiation and the effects of "Image Theory" on vertical radiators.
Furthermore, these three pillars are fundamental to understanding antenna performance:
*	Resonance: This occurs when an antenna's physical length is electrically matched to the operating frequency, causing inductive and capacitive reactances to cancel out. At resonance, the antenna efficiently accepts power from the source, minimizing the Standing Wave Ratio (SWR) and reflected energy.
*	Impedance Matching: This is the process of aligning the antenna’s input impedance with the characteristic impedance of the transmission line (typically 50 or 75Ω). Proper matching ensures maximum power transfer; for example, a standard Simple λ/2 Dipole presents roughly 73Ω, whereas a Folded Dipole transforms this to approximately 300Ω.
*	Radiation Resistance: This is a conceptual resistance representing the power successfully converted into electromagnetic waves. A higher radiation resistance relative to ohmic (heat) resistance indicates a more efficient radiator, as seen in the λ4 Ground Plane antenna, which uses a conductive surface to maintain effective radiation despite its reduced physical size.

# TYPES OF ANTENNAS

## Hertz Antenna
The Hertz antenna is the most elementary radiator used to demonstrate the basic principles of electromagnetic wave propagation. In this specific configuration, the antenna is characterized by having only a single radiating arm connected to the signal source. This setup is utilized in laboratory environments to observe how a lone conductor generates an electric field without the symmetry of a traditional dipole.
| **•	Distinct Physical Features** | Unlike standard dipoles, it features only one straight arm. Physically, it is half the size of a λ/2 dipole, representing a single-pole radiator. |
| **•	Main Use** | Used for basic field induction experiments and to demonstrate the simplest possible form of an open-circuit radiator. |
